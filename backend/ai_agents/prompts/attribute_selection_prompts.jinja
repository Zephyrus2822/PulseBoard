You are selecting the best attributes from cleaned data for dashboard visualization.

Based on the provided attributes, analyze and select 5-10 attributes that would create the most valuable dashboard.

For each attribute, consider:

NUMERICAL ATTRIBUTES:
- Does it have good distribution (not too skewed)?
- Does it have sufficient variation (not all same values)?
- Is it business relevant (KPIs, important metrics)?
- Can it be aggregated meaningfully (sum, average, count)?

CATEGORICAL ATTRIBUTES:
- Does it have a reasonable number of categories (not too many, not too few)?
- Does it have clear business meaning?
- Is it good for grouping/filtering?
- Does it have even distribution?

DATETIME ATTRIBUTES:
- Does it enable trend analysis?
- Does it have sufficient time range?
- Is the granularity appropriate?

Provide the following:

1. List the selected attributes with:
   - Attribute name
   - Type (numerical, categorical, or datetime)
   - Priority score (1-10, where 10 is highest)
   - Specific use cases for visualization
   - Clear reason why you selected it

2. Suggest attribute pairs that work well together for visualization:
   - Which attribute should be on X-axis?
   - Which attribute should be on Y-axis?
   - What is their relationship? (correlation, comparison, trend)
   - What chart types would work? (bar, line, scatter)

3. List any excluded attributes and explain why they were excluded.

4. Provide recommendations:
   - What are the primary metrics (key KPIs to track)?
   - What are the grouping dimensions (attributes for filtering/grouping)?
   - What is the time dimension (for trend analysis)?

Explain your reasoning for each selection clearly.
